<p>This free word finder is the complete helper, cheater and solver for your crossword puzzles, word games, word connect, level games and more.</p>
<p>This is the list of features available:</p>
<p>&bull; ANAGRAM FINDER: find all anagrams from a given word or a set of letters. <br />&bull; STARTS WITH: find all the words that begin with a given set of letters.<br />&bull; WORD SEARCH: given a sequence of letters, finds all the existing words from left to right, like in a word search puzzle game.<br />&bull; SUB ANAGRAMS: given a combination of letters, finds all the possible existing anagrams with same or lesser length.<br />&bull; WILDCARDS: the wildcard "?" is a character that can be replaced by any letter. Use the wildcard to find all the words that match the positions of the given letters. Up to 15 wildcards can be entered.</p>
<p>In the app every feature is better explained, with examples too, by clicking on the question mark.</p>
<p>In the Wildcards' screen a filtering feature is also available: you can select which letters can be replaced by wildcards to reduce the results and to better reproduce the functioning of some games. This can be used, only in the Wildcards' screen, by pressing on the filter icon, next to the help outline button, in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>Currently the following dictionaries are available:<br />&bull; English<br />&bull; Italian<br />&bull; French<br />&bull; Swedish<br />But more will be added in the future.</p>
<p>The App Theme can be set to Light, Dark or according to the Battery Saver/System default.</p>
